## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 1

This is my first favorite lab, because although the purpose of the actual program is humorous, this was a good way to learn the power of programming. This made me realize if I can use the same principle of this program and apply to other situations in my life. I can imagine using it to break down the value of an item that I’m purchasing, given that I can simplify the object into simple geometry. 

Lab 1, Part 1     

Although this was the easiest lab, this is my second favorite. The day felt like we were detectives, because the teacher’s assistants were not helpful and seemed confused themselves. When we were finally able to finish the lab, it felt like we accomplished something. It was also my first introduction to programming, so it will always have a special place for me.

Lab 12, Part 1

This final lab is my third favorite, because it felt like we were actually making something with programming. It also felt like a challenge to figure it all out especially with all the new things we were doing on it. It was also fun to see the final product of the beautiful gif.
